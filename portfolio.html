      <dt><b>- Wordle Remake</b></dt>
      <dd>I developed my own version of the popular online word guessing game, 
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">Wordle</a>. I wrote this solely 
        in C++ as I was most comfortable doing so, but I plan on using JavaScript to make it playable as a web 
        game rather than just a C++ executable. <br><br>

      <dt><b>- Rubik's Cube Solver</b></dt>
      <dd>I am currently working on a program that can solve the Rubik's Cube given any 
        scramble (set of moves that puts the cube in a random, unsolved state). I'm using a software sketchbook 
        and development platform based on Java called Processing to design the graphics and motion of the cube 
        itself, and C++ for the algorithms necessary to solve the cube. The method I'm basing the algorithms off 
        of is called the <a href="https://jperm.net/3x3/cfop" target="_blank">Fridrich Method</a>, often referred 
        to as CFOP to abbreviate the four steps of the process.<br><br>

      <dt><b>- Sarf Generator</b></dt>
      <dd>I wrote a program that takes in root words in Arabic, and outputs all the possible conjugations of that 
        word. I wrote this in Python and used the rules of 
        <a href="https://www.learnarabiconline.com/arabic-morphology-introduction/" target="_blank">Sarf</a>, or 
        Arabic morphology, to tell the program what to output. The user also has the option to choose a particular 
        family of words, which provides a smaller subset of words from the given root. I made this program after
        noticing that nothing like this exists on the Internet or as a mobile app. As I began learning Arabic, I 
        found it very difficult to memorize all the rules of Sarf, so I thought it would be useful to have a 
        program that "checks your work" for you, and can be used as a study tool. I plan to develop this program 
        more in the future, and hopefully pitch the idea to Arabic learning institutions who can then provide 
        the tool to students. <br><br>
