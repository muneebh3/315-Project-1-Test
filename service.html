    <p>As someone who has lived a very fortunate life thus far, I always make sure to give back to my community
       as much as I can. Listed below are descriptions of some of my volunteering/community service activities.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>- Shifa Clinic/Community Service Center</b></dt>
        <dd>Over the years, I have been volunteering at a local 
            <a href="https://www.shifausahouston.org/community-service" target="_blank">community service center </a>
            in Sugar Land. I have helped with several clothing and food drives, assisted patients 
            coming into the clinic, as well as those who came by to ask for aid, and helped set up and host events 
            at the nearby mosque. I've also had the opportunity to put my computer science skills to work by entering 
            clients' data into the system and working on the center's website, which is an ongoing process. I'm in 
            charge of ensuring that all the information on the website (links to other sites, contact information, 
            etc.) is up to date, as well as updating the design to have a more professional look.</dd>
            <br>
        <dt><b>- Alzheimer's Association</b></dt>
        <dd>I formed a team called “Youth Cares” for the 2018
            <a href="https://act.alz.org/site/SPageServer/?pagename=walk_homepage" target="_blank">Walk to End Alzheimer's</a> 
            to help spread awareness for those suffering with Alzheimer's disease. Our team managed to raise $3,000 
            for the cause, with over a hundred people contributing. I also hosted a presentation at my high school 
            to get more students involved, and I invited professionals in the field to present as guest speakers.</dd>
            <br>
        <dt><b>- Texana Children's Center for Autism</b></dt>
        <dd>I spent some time assisting teachers at a learning center for 
            autistic children. During my time there, I got to interact with the kids and observe how the teachers used 
            <a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/applied-behavior-analysis" target="_blank">Applied Behavior Analysis</a> 
            to help them learn important functional skills and minimize problematic behavior.</dd>
            <br>
        <dt><b>- Silverado Memory Care Facility</b></dt>
        <dd>I helped facilitate engagement with the residents at an assisted living facility for those suffering with 
            dementia via activities such as light exercise, board games, jigsaw puzzles, etc, which have 
            <a href="https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/guide/preventing-dementia-brain-exercises" target="_blank">proven benefits</a> 
            for dementia patients. I also helped set up any events planned by the staff at the facility, and frequently 
            conversed with the residents there.</dd>
