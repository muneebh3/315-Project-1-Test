        <dt><b>- Shifa Clinic/Community Service Center</b></dt>
        <dd>Over the years, I have been volunteering at a local community 
            service center in Sugar Land. I have helped with several clothing drives, assisted those who came by 
            to ask for aid as well as patients in the clinic, and am currently working on the center's website to 
            ensure all information is up to date.</dd>
        <dt><b>- Alzheimer's Association</b></dt>
        <dd>I formed a team called “Youth Cares” for the 2018 Walk to End Alzheimer's to 
            help raise awareness for those suffering with Alzheimer's disease. I also hosted a presentation at my 
            high school to get more students involved, and I invited professionals in the field to present as 
            guest speakers.</dd>
        <dt><b>- Texana Children's Center for Autism</b></dt>
        <dd>I spent some time assisting teachers at a learning center for 
            autistic children. During my time there, I got to interact with the kids and observe how the teachers 
            used Applied Behavior Analysis to help them learn important functional skills and minimize problematic 
            behavior.</dd>
        <dt><b>- Silverado Memory Care Facility</b></dt>
        <dd>I helped facilitate engagement with the residents at an assisted living 
            facility for those suffering with dementia via activities such as light exercise, board games, jigsaw 
            puzzles, etc. I also helped set up any events planned by the staff at the facility, and frequently 
            conversed with the residents there.</dd>
