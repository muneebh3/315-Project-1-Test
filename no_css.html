      Howdy! I'm Muneeb Hashmi, an aspiring junior undergraduate 
      student at Texas A&M University studying computer science. I'm part of A&M's Engineering 
      to Medicine program, which is an assured program for medicine, meaning I'm hoping to secure
      a place at the Texas A&M School of Medicine. Although my career interest lies mainly in medicine, 
      I am very enthusiastic about the field of computer science and would love to gain some experience
      working in the industry, especially areas in which the two fields, CS and medicine, merge! I am mainly
      proficient in C++, Python, Java (and apparently HTML and CSS now), and am always looking to 
      expand my knowledge in computing, whether that means learning new languages, improving my 
      problem solving abilities, or trying to get an even better grasp on the fundamentals. Aside from
      my studies, I enjoy playing video games, listening to music, and watching sports.
