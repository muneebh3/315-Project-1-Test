<p align="center" id="blue_text">Howdy! I'm Muneeb Hashmi, an aspiring junior undergraduate 
  student at Texas A&M University studying computer science. I am part of A&M's Engineering 
  to Medicine program, which is an assured program for medicine, meaning I'm hoping to secure
  a place at the Texas A&M School of Medicine. Although my career interest lies mainly in medicine, 
  I am very enthusiastic about the field of computer science and would love to gain some experience
  working in the industry, especially areas in which the two fields, CS and medicine, merge! I am
  proficient in C++, Python, Java (and apparently HTML and CSS now), and am always looking to 
  expand my knowledge in computing, whether that means learning new languages, improving my 
  problem solving abilities, or trying to get an even better grasp on the fundamentals. Aside from
  my studies, I enjoy playing video games, listening to music, and watching sports.

  Here on my webpage you can find information regarding my qualifications, prior work experience, 
  resume and portfolio, experience with service to humanity, projects I'm currently working on, 
  my LinkedIn page, and more. You can learn more about these by following the links in the menu
  at the top left of the page!
